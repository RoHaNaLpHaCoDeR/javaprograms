        Why do we need collections

        We need collections for efficient storage and better manipulation of data in java

        For ex: we use arrays to store integers but what if we want to

        Resize this array?
        Insert an element in between?
        Delete an elements in Array?
        Apply certain operations to change this array?

        ArrayList -> For variables size collections
        Set -> For distinct collection
