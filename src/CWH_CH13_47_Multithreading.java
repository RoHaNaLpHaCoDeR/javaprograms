        /* Concurrency - perform multiple task at the same time
        but doing only one task at single instant of time.

        Parallelism - Performing multiple tasks at the same time
        and executing all the tasks simultaneously.

        If the OS is free the other task is executed which leads to
        completing of multiple tasks at the same time leading to
        less wastage of time and more of work so multithreading is
        an important task in JAVA  programming.
